Never Have I Ever
=======

Never Have I Ever (or Ten Fingers) is a party game that, according to Wikipedia, involves drinking. Of course, this becomes somewhat of an obstacle when your only friends are people you talk to using your phone. Don't worry though, because you can now play the game on Happening without any of the potential liver damage or excitement.

In case you don't know what this is about: Happening is a group app for iOS and Android, that allows you to create your own plugins in minutes. To get started signup at: https://develop.happening.im
